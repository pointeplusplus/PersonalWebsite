		<h1>Welcome to my Website :)</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
  		<p class="odd"> <!-- 1 -->
	   I am a junior at RPI in Computer and Systems Engineering wath a computer science dual major.  I am very much a cat person; I have my two boys at home. One of my favorite things is dancing, and I particularly love ballet.  I like going to Renaissance Faires in the summer (and I dress up).  I'm also a faerie fan and a tea drinker.

		<h2>Dance</h2>
		<p class="even"> <!-- 2 -->
		 I have been taking ballet lessons for about a year and a half, and it quickly became my favorite hobby.  I mostly take lessons at The Dance Experience.  We have a recital every spring :).  I also take lessons from RPI's dance club.  I have also taken a little of modern, tap, and ballroom.

		<h2>Cats </h2>
		<p class="odd">
		My two cats were born on my 8<sup>th</sup> birthday and I named them Puffy and Galloping (when I was 8).  They might be "senior" cats, but I still call them my kittens, and they still act like them.  More Puffy, Galloping has a tendency to sleep and laze around.  I miss them a lot when I'm at school, and I say I get my "kitten fix" whenever I see them.  I can't wait to take them! &lt;3.  I also have seen a bunch of cats in Troy while I've been in school: <a href="http://pointeplusplus.com/kittensoftroy.html"> Kittens of Troy</a>
