		<h1>Kittens of Troy</h1>
		<h2>Sullivan</h2>
  		<p class="bubble"> <!-- 1 -->
	   Sulley was the first cat that I started seeing routinely around.  Now he sees me as a steady food source.  I've also spotted him around with a similar long-haired cat that I think might be his brother.  He is a very beautiful cat, and he likes to sleep next to people and put his paws on our legs.  He also loves cheese, and he will meow (loudly) until he gets it.

		<h2>Cleo</h2>
		<p class="bubble"> <!-- 2 -->
		 Cleo is a little cat, and is very cuddly.  She's a lap kitty and loves to be held.  Fitting in with her sweet disposition, she is also really endearing and sleeps with her hand over her face.  We're pretty sure she's manipulating us into giving her tons of food (about which she is pretty picky).
